# Movie-Box-Office-Analysis
Data Viz and Analysis using seaborn and plotly from TMDb dataset.

# Project Details:
One of my first data viz projects while I was learning Data Science back in July-August 2020. Followed tutorials by Snehan Kekre and built up on them. Used both Seaborn and Plotly for visualization.

# Data Preprocessing and Engineering:
Had to do some feature engineering on the dataset:
- Created log of revenue
- Created log of budget
- Created a feature to indicate whether a film has a webpage
- Converted date into better format
- Created Features for release date of film based on 'year', 'weekday', 'month', 'weekofyear', 'day', 'quarter' of release
